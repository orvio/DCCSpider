//Interrupt generation makro from DCC++
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// DEFINE THE INTERRUPT LOGIC THAT GENERATES THE DCC SIGNAL
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// The code below will be called every time an interrupt is triggered on OCNB, where N can be 0 or 1.
// It is designed to read the current bit of the current register packet and
// updates the OCNA and OCNB counters of Timer-N to values that will either produce
// a long (200 microsecond) pulse, or a short (116 microsecond) pulse, which respectively represent
// DCC ZERO and DCC ONE bits.

// These are hardware-driven interrupts that will be called automatically when triggered regardless of what
// DCC++ BASE STATION was otherwise processing.  But once inside the interrupt, all other interrupt routines are temporarily diabled.
// Since a short pulse only lasts for 116 microseconds, and there are TWO separate interrupts
// (one for Main Track Registers and one for the Program Track Registers), the interrupt code must complete
// in much less than 58 microsends, otherwise there would be no time for the rest of the program to run.  Worse, if the logic
// of the interrupt code ever caused it to run longer than 58 microsends, an interrupt trigger would be missed, the OCNA and OCNB
// registers would not be updated, and the net effect would be a DCC signal that keeps sending the same DCC bit repeatedly until the
// interrupt code completes and can be called again.

// A significant portion of this entire program is designed to do as much of the heavy processing of creating a properly-formed
// DCC bit stream upfront, so that the interrupt code below can be as simple and efficient as possible.

// Note that we need to create two very similar copies of the code --- one for the Main Track OC1B interrupt and one for the
// Programming Track OCOB interrupt.  But rather than create a generic function that incurrs additional overhead, we create a macro
// that can be invoked with proper paramters for each interrupt.  This slightly increases the size of the code base by duplicating
// some of the logic for each interrupt, but saves additional time.

// As structured, the interrupt code below completes at an average of just under 6 microseconds with a worse-case of just under 11 microseconds
// when a new register is loaded and the logic needs to switch active register packet pointers.

// THE INTERRUPT CODE MACRO:  R=REGISTER LIST (mainRegs or progRegs), and N=TIMER (0 or 1)
